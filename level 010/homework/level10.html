<h1>THE HISTORY OF GEORGIA</h1>

<p>The nation of <b>Georgia</b> (Georgian: საქართველო sakartvelo) was first unified as a kingdom under the Bagrationi dynasty by the King <b>Bagrat III of Georgia</b> in the early 11th century, arising from several predecessor states of the ancient kingdoms of <b>Colchis</b> and <b>Iberia</b>. The Kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 10th to 12th centuries under <b>King David IV the Builder</b> and Queen <b>Tamar the Great</b>, and fell to the <u>Mongol invasion</u> by 1243, and after a brief reunion under <b>George V the Brilliant</b> to the <u>Timurid Empire</u>. By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into several petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the <u>Early Modern period</u> struggled to maintain their autonomy against <b>Ottoman</b>> and <b>Iranian</b> domination until Georgia was finally annexed by the <b>Russian Empire</b> in the 19th century. After a brief period of independence as <b>Democratic Republic of Georgia</b>, the country soon ended up being a <b>Soviet Republic</b>> until <u>the dissolution of the Soviet Union</u>. The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991.</p>

<h1>Prehistoric period</h1>

<p>Evidence for the earliest occupation of the territory of present-day Georgia goes back to c. 1.8 million years ago, as evident from the excavations of <b>Dmanisi</b> in the southeastern part of the country. This is the oldest evidence of humans anywhere in the world outside Africa. Later prehistoric remains (<b>Acheulian</b>, <b>Mousterian</b>, and the Upper <b>Palaeolithic</b>) are known from numerous cave and open-air sites in Georgia. The earliest agricultural <b>Neolithic</b> occupation dates between 6000 and 5000 BC. known as the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, where people used local <b>obsidian</b> for tools, raised animals such as cattle and pigs, and grew crops, including grapes.</p>
