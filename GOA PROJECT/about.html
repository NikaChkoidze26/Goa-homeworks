    <p class="p">At first, we teach students python, html, css and js. But after some time they can choose between:</p>
    <br>

    <div class="container">
        <ul class="goaul">
            <li>Game Development</li>
            <li>Cyber Security</li>
            <li>Design</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p class="p">Every month we host Hackathons, which is a contest where students are divided into groups and compete in different ways, like code exercises, kahoot and pushup contests. The winners get a money prize. GOA also has GOALAND, which is a massive event where every student goes and there are fun events and food.</p>

    <h1 class="h1">Mentors & Leaders</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p class="p">When you join GOA, you get to choose a leader who will help you with anything you ask and check up on your classworks and homeworks.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="p">In GOA, the people who teach you are mentors. Their purpose is to help you understand programming and make it more interesting for you. We have amazing mentors like Mr. Dato Janezashvili, who is my mentor and many more</p>
